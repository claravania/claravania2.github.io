I am an Applied Scientist in the Amazon Alexa team in Cambridge. I am currently working on topics related to large-scale information extraction and large language models. Before that, I was a Post-Doctoral Associate at the [ML^2, Center for Data Science, New York University](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/), where I worked with [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman) on crowdsourcing and transfer learning for NLU. I got my PhD from the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of [Adam Lopez](http://alopez.github.io/) and [Sharon Goldwater](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/). 

My main research interests lie in the area of natural language understanding and machine learning. I am interested in applying machine learning techiques and exploring linguistic resources to help machine learning models understand world's languages.
